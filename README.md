I participated in Rafayel Fan Art Contest and they said that the content could be anything related to Rafayel's birthday. Drawing and making something related to art is not my expertise, so I made this night lamp whether my project is accepted or not, I still obtain knowledge and hands-on practice in microcontrollers.

Where does the idea come from? 🤔 It happens when we have a convo about drift bottles, he always sends 'em when he wants someone to keep him company. That's why I called this project...

<h1>✨Hope in a bottle✨</h1>

💡The warm hues of the LED lamp make someone comfortable and get rid of feeling empty. Yet, it is still in progress because of less preparation. I plan to develop an IoT mobile version when I have enough time. 😅

Curious about how it builds from scratch till the end? Let's dive in...

## First, you should have the electronic components such as

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvehyvk3d/image/upload/v1741357668/arduino_xvudfh.jpg" width="150"></td>

    <td><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvehyvk3d/image/upload/v1741357667/passive_buzzer_indxaz.webp" width="150"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Arduino Uno R3</b></td>
    <td><b>Jumper Wire Female to Male</b></td>
    <td><b>Relay Module 1 Channel 12V</b></td>
    <td><b>Passive Buzzer</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You should have a screwdriver (for tightening or loosening cables on screw terminals), a razor blade (for stripping the lamp cable), and a soldering iron (if the electronic components don’t have pre-attached legs).

## Second, make sure you connect with the right pins. Here is the wiring diagram below

| Components                 | Connect to Arduino      |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Passive Buzzer**       | GND → GND <br> I/O → 8 <br> VCC → 5V |
| **Relay Module 1 Channel 12V** | VCC → VIN <br> GND → GND <br> IN → 3 |

After stripping the lamp cable, you can connect the USB lamp to COM and the lamp cable to NO on the relay. Please use chromium to run this application.

## And... this is the final result

I finished this project in one day, still challenging tho 

Here is the photo of the birthday merman. I got his birthday card effortlessly 😎

Although he will never replace real human connections, he has helped me through my lowest moments. Big thanks to the LaDs devs for creating a character like Rafayel! He’s not just an inspiration to me but also encourages others to [symbolically adopt blue whales](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGFYNlzvtkO/?img_index=1) through WWF. I hope this fandom continues to spread positivity in the future.

Last but not least, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY BELOVED FISHIE!🌊🌊🌊

Ah, it's not over yet

I guess I got the idea from this chat 😏
well, looking forward to it

When an engineer meets an artist. Their inspiration and invention range to go! 🌊🌊🌊
