I participated in Rafayel's Art Contest and they said that the content could be anything related to Rafayel's birthday. Drawing and making something related to art is not my expertise, so I made this night lamp whether my project is accepted or not, I still obtain knowledge and hands-on practice in microcontrollers.

Where does the idea come from? 🤔 It happens when we have a convo about drift bottles, he always sends 'em when he wants someone to keep him company. That's why I called this project...

<h1>✨Hope in a bottle✨</h1>

💡The warm hues of the LED lamp make someone comfortable and get rid of feeling empty. Yet, it is still in progress because of less preparation. I plan to develop an IoT mobile version when I have enough time. 😅

Curious about how it builds from scratch till the end? Let's dive in...

## First, you should have the electronic components such as

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvehyvk3d/image/upload/v1741357668/arduino_xvudfh.jpg" width="150"></td>

    <td><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dvehyvk3d/image/upload/v1741357667/passive_buzzer_indxaz.webp" width="150"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Arduino Uno R3</b></td>
    <td><b>Jumper Wire Female to Male</b></td>
    <td><b>Relay Module 1 Channel 12V</b></td>
    <td><b>Passive Buzzer</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You should have a screwdriver (for tightening or loosening cables on screw terminals), a razor blade (for stripping the lamp cable), and a soldering iron (if the electronic components don’t have pre-attached legs).

## Second, make sure you connect with the right pins. Here is the wiring diagram below

| Components                 | Connect to Arduino      |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Passive Buzzer**       | GND → GND <br> I/O → 8 <br> VCC → 5V |
| **Relay Module 1 Channel 12V** | VCC → VIN <br> GND → GND <br> IN → 3 |

After stripping the lamp cable, you can connect the USB lamp to COM and the lamp cable to NO on the relay. Please use chromium to run this application.

## And... this is the final result

I finished this project in one day, still challenging tho 

Here is the photo of the birthday merman. I got his birthday card effortless 😎

Although he will never replace real human connections, he has helped me through my lowest moments. Huge thanks to the LaDs devs for creating a character like Rafayel! He’s not just an inspiration to me but also encourages others to [symbolically adopt blue whales](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGFYNlzvtkO/?img_index=1) through WWF. I hope this fandom continues to spread positivity in the future.

Last but not least, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY BELOVED FISHIE!🌊🌊🌊
